# Clustering World Countries

#### Aim of the project is to compare different countries all over the world by implementing K-means and Hierarchical Clustering methods. The attributes for clustering are selected from the World Indicator Dataset that includes information about each country regarding its GDP, Population, Energy Usage, Mortality Rates, etc. (Created in October 2022)

## Project Flow
* Clean the data by removing or replacing missing values
* Use K-means and Hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries together
* Use Internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality
* Report the best clustering solution. Give a detailed list of all the groups and the countries included within the groups.
* Generate three different scatter plots and color the data points according to the group.
